# Data-Warehouse-Project

This is a hands-on SQL-based Data Warehousing project I built from scratch by following industry-standard Medallion Architecture. I used 6 real-world datasets (3 CRM and 3 ERP) and organized them into structured layers: Bronze → Silver → Gold. All transformations were done using raw SQL scripts in SQL Server Express (not GUI or automation tools).

Tools & Stack:
1. SQL Server Express + SSMS
2. SQL (raw scripts only)
3. CSV files (6 datasets)
4. Manual Data Modeling
5. Self-debugging with SELECT, JOIN, LEN(), TRIM(), etc.
